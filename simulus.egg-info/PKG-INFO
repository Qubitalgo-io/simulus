# Simulus

**The Butterfly Effect Engine**

A deterministic probabilistic reasoning engine that simulates how small decisions
cascade into radically different futures. Describe any situation, make a choice,
and watch reality branch.

---

## What is this?

Simulus is a terminal-based simulation tool built on a simple philosophical premise:
if the universe is deterministic, then every decision you make has consequences that
ripple forward through time in predictable (but chaotic) ways.

You describe a situation in plain English. Simulus parses it, builds a causal graph
of possible decisions and their consequences, assigns probabilities using Bayesian
reasoning, and simulates your future 6 levels deep.

Then it shows you the butterfly effect: change one tiny probability by 1%, and watch
your entire future rearrange itself.

## How it works

Simulus is not a chatbot and it is not a wrapper around an LLM. It is a custom-built
probabilistic reasoning engine with four distinct stages:

### 1. Situation Parser

Natural language processing extracts the key elements from your input: who is involved,
what is at stake, the environment, and the emotional context. This uses spaCy for
dependency parsing and entity extraction.

### 2. Causal Graph Builder

A directed acyclic graph is constructed where each node is a state of the world and
each edge is a possible action or consequence. The graph branches at decision points
and cascades through 6 levels of cause and effect. Built on networkx.

### 3. Bayesian Probability Engine

Each branch in the graph is assigned a conditional probability using Bayesian inference.
Probabilities are not guessed -- they are computed from prior distributions and updated
as evidence flows through the graph.

### 4. Butterfly Effect Simulator

A Lyapunov-style chaos multiplier is applied at each depth level. Small differences
in initial probabilities are amplified exponentially as they cascade through the tree.
A Monte Carlo simulator runs 10,000 iterations to produce statistical distributions
of outcomes.

## Features

**Interactive mode** -- Describe any situation and explore branching futures in a
cinematic terminal interface.

**Replay mode** -- Re-run any simulation with the same seed and get byte-identical
results. Rewind to any decision point and take the other path. See how your life
diverges.

**Butterfly mode** -- Apply a tiny perturbation (0.01 change in one probability) and
compare the two resulting futures side by side. Witness the butterfly effect in action.

**Deterministic by design** -- Same seed, same input, same future. Every time. This is
the philosophical core of the project: in a deterministic universe, the future is fixed.
The only variable is your knowledge of the initial conditions.

## Installation

```
pip install simulus
```

Or from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/qubitalgo/simulus.git
cd simulus
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Interactive mode

```
simulus
```

You will be prompted to describe a situation. The engine will generate a decision tree
and animate it in your terminal.

### With a specific scenario

```
simulus --scenario "I am about to quit my job to start a company"
```

### Replay with a seed

```
simulus --scenario "asking for a raise at lunch" --seed 42
```

Run this twice. You will get the exact same future both times.

### Butterfly mode

```
simulus --scenario "asking for a raise at lunch" --seed 42 --butterfly
```

Watch two nearly identical realities diverge into completely different futures.

### Replay alternate track

```
simulus --scenario "asking for a raise at lunch" --seed 42 --rewind 2
```

Rewind to decision point 2 and take the path not taken.

## The Philosophy

This project is a computational exploration of determinism, chaos theory, and the
nature of choice.

Laplace argued in 1814 that a sufficiently powerful intellect, knowing the position
and momentum of every particle, could predict the entire future. Simulus is a small
step toward that demon -- a system that takes a snapshot of a situation and extrapolates
the consequences.

But it also demonstrates why Laplace's Demon is impossible in practice. Chaos theory
shows that infinitesimally small differences in initial conditions lead to exponentially
divergent outcomes. The butterfly effect is not a metaphor -- it is a mathematical
property of nonlinear dynamical systems, and Simulus makes it visible.

The deterministic seed system is the philosophical punchline: your future was decided
the moment the seed was set. Free will is an illusion. But what an illusion it is.
